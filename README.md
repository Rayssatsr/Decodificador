# 🔐 Text Decoder Project

Welcome to the **Text Decoder Project**! This application allows you to encode and decode text using a custom cipher. The purpose of this project is to enable you to exchange secret messages with others who know the encoding method.

## 🚀 Features

- **🔄 Text Encoding**: Convert regular text into encoded text using a specific set of rules.
- **🔓 Text Decoding**: Convert encoded text back into its original form.
- **✅ Input Validation**: Ensures only lowercase letters without accents or special characters are processed.
- **📋 Copy to Clipboard**: Easily copy the encoded/decoded text to your clipboard with a single click.
- **📱 Responsive Design**: The interface is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## 🔤 Encoding Rules

The following rules are used to encode the text:

- `e` becomes `enter`
- `i` becomes `imes`
- `a` becomes `ai`
- `o` becomes `ober`
- `u` becomes `ufat`

For example, the word `gato` would be encoded as `gaitober`, and `gaitober` would be decoded back to `gato`.

## 📋 Requirements

- Works only with lowercase letters.
- No accents or special characters allowed.
- The user should be able to:
  - Encode a word to its encoded version.
  - Decode an encoded word back to its original form.
